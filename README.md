SolAR Triangulation
=============

SolAR is an open-source framework released under Apache license 2.0 making possible to easily create your own camera pose estimation solution to develop Augmented Reality applications. 
SolAR is dedicated to Augmented Reality (AR).
It offers a C++ SDK to easily and quickly develop and use custom solutions for camera pose estimation. It provides developers with a full chain from low-level vision components development to camera pose estimation pipelines and AR service development.

The SolAR Triangulation sample shows a SolAR pipeline that sparsely reconstruct a 3D scene given to viewpoints.

To run it, launch the SolARTriangulationSample.exe. You ill visualize the 3D point cloud built from two viewpoints.

Press escape to quit the application.

If you want to change the calibration parameters of the camera, edit the camera_calibration.yml.

To change properties of the components of the triangulation pipeline, edit the .xml file.
